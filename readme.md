## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was interestested in researching the relationship between geo-location and price using the seattle airbnb data by trying to answer following questions:

- **How many clusters can we get using the lat, lon values in the Dataset?**
- **Is the geo-clusters strongly correlated with the price?**
- **During prediction of the price, would the feature 'geo cluster' be helpful?**
